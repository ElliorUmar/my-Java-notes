	Abstraction in Java.

	What's abstraction in Java?
	When we focus what object does instead of how it does. We can achieve abstraction in java by using abstract classes and interfaces.

	Can you tell me more about abstract class?
	- Abstract class is a class that can have abstract methods.  
	- We cannot create object out of abstract class directly. Abstract class will be useful when it has concrete classes.
	- Abstract  class can have regular methods and instance variables.

	What's the difference between abstract class and interface?
	- abstract class can have both asbtract and non asbstract methods and interface can have only abstract methods(except default and static).
	- abstract class can have instance variables but interface can have only public static final variables.
	- we can extends only one abstract class but we can implement many interfaces.
	- abstract class use extends(inheritance) and interface uses implements.

	What are the two type of methods that can have bodies in the interface?
	- default and static methods can have bodies
