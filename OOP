	What's the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
	- overloading is when we have methods with the different type, number, or order of arguments with the same name in the class.
	- overriding when child class overrides parent class's methods. 
	Rules for overriding:
	  1. The same name.
	  2. The access modifier should be same or more visible.
	  3. Return type should be the same or covariant.
	  4. Arguments should be the same.
	  5. if parent method has exception declared, the child method can have the same or smaller exception, or non.

	- no  

	What are the two class that every class will extend from?

	How to prevent class from being extended?
	- make class final.

	How to prevent method from being overrided?
	- make method final.

	How to compare custom object from the same class?
	1. We will override equals and hashCode methods.
