// Map is key value data structure. 
		// Map is not part of the collections because it doesn't extend Collections or Iterable, 
		// but still java provides Map as ready API for us to use.
		// Each element of the map referred as entity.
		// Map works with Object only for keys and values
		// Map<K, V>
		// K - data type for Key
		// V - data type for Value


		Map is key value data structure
	- the keys are unique in map.
	- map doesn't extend Collection interface.

	How to iterate over the map?
	- we can get all the keys by using keySet and iterate over the keys, once we have keys we can get correct values by using get(K) method
