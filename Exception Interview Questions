Exception Interview Questions

	What's are the differences between runtime and checked exceptions?
	- runtime excpetions are optional to handle and checked exceptions we must handle them.
	- All runtime exceptions extends from RuntimeException class and checked exceptions are extends from Exception class(except RuntimeException).

	How do you handle exceptions in Java?
	- I use try catch.

	When do you get NullPointerException?
	- when object is null and then when we try to use some properties or methods.
	  String str = null;
	  System.out.println(str.length()); // NullPointerException is here

	What are the final, finally, and finalize keyword in java?
	final:
	- if we make our variable final, we cannot change the value(constants)
	- if we make our class final, we cannot extend it.
	- if we make our method final, we cannot override it.

	fianlly:
	- we use finally together with try catch statement. finally block always runs. Usually we use it to close our resources(file, db connections).

	finalize:
	- suggestion to GC for clean up.

	What are the Error in java?
	- Usually they thrown by JVM.
	- We don't work with error - we don't handle them, and we don't throw them.
	- Examples for error - memory overflow.
